## **Support Ticket Priority Prediction Workflow**

### **Objective**  
Develop a model to predict support ticket priority (e.g., P1, P2, P3) based on text content, automating prioritization and improving resolution efficiency.

---

### **1. Problem Definition**  
- **Goal**: Predict priority levels of support tickets from descriptions.
- **Input**: Ticket data (e.g., subject, description).
- **Output**: Predicted priority label (P1, P2, P3).

---

### **2. Data Collection**  
- **Sources**: Historical data from systems (Jira, ServiceNow).
- **Fields**: Ticket ID, Subject, Description, Priority.
- **Format**: CSV, Excel, database export.

---

### **3. Data Exploration**  
- Inspect dataset for:
  - Missing values, class imbalance, and text length.
  - Common terms in high-priority tickets.

---

### **4. Data Preprocessing**  
- **Text Cleaning**: Remove special characters, stop words, and convert to lowercase.
- **Tokenization**: Split text into words.
- **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to roots.
- **Handle Missing Data**: Impute with placeholders.
- **Encode Priority**: Map labels (P1 = 0, P2 = 1, P3 = 2).

---

### **5. Feature Engineering**  
- **Text Features**: Use BoW, TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec).
- **Additional Features**: Submission time, text length.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use PCA or TruncatedSVD.

---

### **6. Train-Test Split**  
- Split data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets, ensuring class balance.

---

### **7. Model Selection**  
- **Baseline Models**: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes.
- **Advanced Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, BERT.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix.

---

### **8. Model Training**  
- Train using selected features and perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., Grid Search).
- Use cross-validation for model generalization.

---

### **9. Model Evaluation**  
- Evaluate on the test set.
- Analyze misclassifications for model improvement.

---

### **10. Model Deployment**  
- Build an end-to-end pipeline for preprocessing, feature extraction, and prediction.
- Deploy as REST API (Flask, FastAPI, Django) for integration.
- Monitor performance and retrain periodically.

---

### **11. Documentation**  
- Document:
  - Data sources, preprocessing, model architecture.
  - Deployment instructions and usage.

---

### **12. Visualization**  
- Create a dashboard to:
  - Visualize priority distribution, predictions vs. actuals, and performance metrics.

---

### **13. Continuous Improvement**  
- Gather user feedback, analyze edge cases, and refine the model over time.
